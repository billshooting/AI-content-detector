# AI-content-detector

There are 2 different parts of this project: `code detector` and `general text detector`

## General Methodology
We all know that `perplexity` can measure if a text is close to LLM generated text (with loss).

Perplexity (PPL) can be calculated by the following formulas:
``` math
Cross Entropy = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nlogp(x_n|x_1,x_2,...,x_{i-1})
```
``` math
PPL = exp(Cross Entropy)
```
If we know the very detailed information of a LLM `M`, we can use $$ PPL < threshold (M)$$ as a condition to predict the assumption with confidence.

However, since it's no way to know the exact detail of a model (e.g. GPT-4o), even we don't know which model is the source of given text, calculating PPL directly is not feasible.

To address this issue, I propose we can use many of the same architecture models to approximate the distribution of PPL. By calculating the PPL vector and letting a DNN learn from the PPL vectors, the DNN model will learn the capability to predict the source of given text.

The whole steps are shown as follows:

1. Collect the training dataset: 25% OpenAI + 25% DeepSeek + 50% human text
2. Use 20 different small size or moderate size LLM, to calculate the PPL
3. Then we will have `10000 * 1 * 20` tensor as input.
4. Train a new deep neural network on the tensor.
5. validate the result on another `2000 * 1 * 20`.



## Code Detector

### Data Collection
Total Dataset Size is `12000`. Among them, `6000` is human written codes extracted from Hugging Face dataset: `code_search_net`. I extracted 4 programming languages: Python, Java, Go, JavaScript with 1500 each.

The rest `6000` data is generated by `OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)` and `DeepSeek (DeepSeek V3)` via APIs. All of them are use random selected prompt from 166 prepared prompts pool. These prompts are also generated by LLMs (mainly GPT-4o and DeepSeek R1). The prompts used to generate codes are shown as follows:

The random selected prompt will concat with the following text: `", if this question has been asked, try to use a different answer. Only response codes and comments, no other content: "` to ensure the model response unique and code-only content.

### Model Used
Most people used AI-generated content are generated from very large, commercial-used LLMs with decoder-only architectures. For example, ChatGPT (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o) and DeepSeek R1, Grok. If we want to approximate these models' PPL, we would like to use the same decoder-only architecture models. Moreover, to reduce the calculation time, the size of these models should be small. Although one small model cannot approximate the true model, but many of them still have high probability to represent the true model somehow.

Belows are the models I used.
